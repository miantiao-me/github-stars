# webdav-js

A simple way to administer a WebDAV filesystem from your browser.

The original aim for this project was to provide a bookmarklet for use when you want to administer a WebDAV server,
without the need for using a third party application.

The application has since been rewritten to not rely on jQuery and use more modern methods and provide a single runtime
file. Now that there's more separation between the interface code and the library code, I'd like to investigate using
other frontend approaches to see which I prefer (and also to weigh up the differences between the currently available
frameworks). There's still work to do around code separation and hopefully this will be something I can continue to work
on (as time allows) I feel it's at least as stable as the previous version.

## Features

- Browse, upload, download, rename, delete entries and create directories.
- File preview for image, video, audio, font, text, PDF files.
- Basic keyboard navigation.
- A (very) simple gallery browser for preview-able files.

## Localisation

Currently, the library contains text translated to English, German and Portuguese. If you use this and would like it to
be localised to your language please submit a PR including the translation (using [en.json](translations/en.json) as a template) and adding the
language in [UI.js](src/lib/UI/UI.js).

## Tested in:

- Chrome
- Firefox
- Edge

## Implementations

### Gitpod demo

[Available here](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/dom111/webdav-js), wait for the Docker build to complete, and you
will be able to interact with the Apache demo, make changes and contribute!

### Apache:

There is also an example for how you could set up Apache in the `examples/` directory (one using a locally hosted
version of the library, and one using a CDN).

Think you have another example implementation that would be good to showcase?
[Fork this repository](https://github.com/dom111/webdav-js/fork) and make a PR!

## Test the library

Included in the package is a `docker-compose.yml` file that can spawn an Alpine Linux Apache WebDAV server that uses the
example Apache configuration so you can see the library in action if you don't have a WebDAV server at your disposal.

To start it, run:

    docker-compose up

and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`.

## Contributing

If you feel this can be improved (I'm certain it can!), please feel free to fork it and submit a PR.

Localisation would be a great start if you'd like to help!

To start making changes, ensure you install all the dependencies and build the application:

    make build

After making changes, ensure you rebuild the application:

    make build

Once your changes have compiled you can test using the Docker container.

### Tests

To run the unit and functional tests:

    make build
    docker-compose up -d
    make test
